# is_narcissistic-rust

A narcissistic decimal number is a non-negative integer, N, that is equal to the sum of the M-th powers of each of the digits in the decimal representation of N, where M is the number of digits in the decimal representation of N.

Here we are generating the first 25 narcissistic decimal numbers.

## Example
if n is 153
then m (the number of decimal digits) is 3
we have 1³ + 5³ + 3³ = 1 + 125 + 27 = 153
and so 153 is a narcissistic decimal number :)
